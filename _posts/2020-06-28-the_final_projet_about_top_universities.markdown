This project is a big challenge for me, because they do not have any guidance and support, you need to complete it independently and ensure that it can run normally. Not only that, we have to create a separate folder, and use the previous gem to make it call out, I spent a lot of time.
When I prepare for this project, I must first conceive the entire framework, and I must be clear about what I need to do. I learned some materials that can browse certain web pages, and then chose the world university ranking. Because I think ranking is easier for me. Because the name of the university, ranking, address can be my code. So my idea is to integrate the university with all its information, which can be provided to users when they enter information.
Now that I know how to do it, the next step is to integrate our code. I choose a university in the world ranking, and convert my code to connect. On this page, we can also find university rankings and addresses, as well as more information about universities. All I have to do is separate this information and write it in my code, and adjust the stable operation.
In my code, I created a university option that connects the university to each of its information. When you look at each university, if needed, my code will provide you with tips for additional information.
The overall structure and framework as well as my personal thoughts are like this. In the end, it also runs smoothly, which makes me very happy, and this project makes me feel that my computer technology has risen again, and I am very proud. Thank you very much for the opportunity the school has brought me, and I will continue to cheer.
